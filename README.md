# Front end portion for AABB Skincare. A project for CSUN's COMP 380 course.

### This front end was built using the React framework and stylised with help from Bootstrap.
It utilises the Axios API to make requests to the back end portion and is connected to several MongoDB collections.
To start the site locally, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository onto your local machine.
  ```git clone https://github.com/joselclee/website-front-end.git```

2. Ensure you have the back end application running before proceeding below. *Skipping this step will lead to an unfinished site*.
  
3. Ensure you have **Node.js** and **JavaScript** enabled in your browser of choice.
 
4. Run these commands in your terminal: </br>
  ```npm install react react-scripts@latest axios dotenv react-bootstrap react-router-dom``` OR ```npm install package.json``` to install dependencies needed to run the project. </br>
  ```cd beauty``` to get to the react directory. And </br>
  ```npm start``` to start the project. Afterwards, navigate to </br>
  ```http://localhost:3000/``` to see the web application. </br>
